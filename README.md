# Predicting-Online-Ad-Click-Through-Rates-Using-Logistic-Regression

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will click on an online advertisement during their internet usage. The goal is to develop a Logistic Regression model that can answer this binary classification question based on various features such as daily internet usage, age, and more. By understanding customer behavior, the business can optimize its advertising strategy and increase its exposure.

**Project Structure**

- **Data:** The dataset used is the "advertising" dataset, which contains information on customer behavior, such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, and whether the customer clicked on the ad.

- **Model:** Logistic Regression is used as the primary model for binary classification.

- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, and accuracy score.

**Technologies Used**

- **Python:** Programming language.

- **Pandas and Numpy:** For data manipulation and analysis and for numerical computations respectively.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.

- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.

- **Google Colab Notebook:** For interactive development and exploration.

**Results**

The Logistic Regression model successfully predicted the likelihood of a customer clicking on an ad with an accuracy of approximately 89.5%. The analysis revealed that features like daily internet usage and age significantly influence the click-through rate.
